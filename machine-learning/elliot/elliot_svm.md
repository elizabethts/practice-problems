Support Vector Machine (SVM)


#### What are the basic concepts? What problem does it solve?
- Support vector machines focus only on the points that are the most difficult to tell apart, whereas other classifiers pay attention to all of the points.
- If a classifier is good at the most challenging comparisons, then the classifier will be even better at the easy comparisons
- unlike other classifiers, the SVM is explicitly told to find the best separating line

#### What are the assumptions?
- no distributional assumptions other than iid
- scale data first

#### What are the steps of the algorithm?
- Searches for closest points, called support vectors
- Draw a line connecting them by vector subtraction
- Declares the best separating line to be the line that bisects and is perpendicular to the connecting line

If the problem is non-linear:
- no good hyperplane can be found, so use kernel trick
- this involves projecting the original, non-linear space to a higher dimensional one with a non-linear transformation, so you can do a plain SVM
- kernels include: linear, polynomial, radial basis function, sigmoid

#### What is the cost function?
- Uses hinge loss and L2 regularization: maximize the margin

#### What are the advantages/disadvantages?
Pros:
- Avoids overfitting because of regularization
- Kernel trick allows complex problem solving, like for non-linear models
- Generalizes well
- Better than neural networks as it gives a unique solution

Cons
- Have to choose the right kernel function, which can affect overfitting
- Only classifies, does not provide class probabilities
- Have to tune the hyperparameters correctly (kernel type, kernel specific parameters)
- Long training time
- Difficult to understand and interpret the model
